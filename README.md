A Component Framework built with Bootstrap and Vue.js users in mind.

### What is Carbon?
Carbon is a set of components + awesome hacks built to help web developers speed up their proccesses by letting them build sites with tailor-made UI components.

### Why Carbon?
Carbon is the main chemical element found in life. So, the Carbon Framework is the main framework found in all of our sites.

### How was Carbon built?
We used **SASS** and **JS** to develop most of the core components, and we built the whole thing so that **it runs smoothly over Bootstrap 4** (Twitter **Bootstrap is not 100%** required, but some components are built to work **only** with Bootstrap).
